# Module 2 Challenge
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
For this challenge, I've built a simple one-page portfolio site. Beyond the given criteria, I wanted to use this project to get more practice with flex and grid, and to include at least one tooltip. Other notable features include: 
- A viewport which smoothly transitions between different widths.
- A tooltip in the footer which includes a link to the top of the page.
- Animations on clickable links.
